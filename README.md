# About Me

## My Interests
Hello! I'm passionate about swords, particularly their history and how they've been depicted across different cultures. From Japanese katanas to European longswords, swords have always intrigued me both as weapons and symbols of power. I enjoy studying sword techniques, including martial systems like HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) and Kendo. In my free time, I love watching anime, especially ones that feature sword fighting, and exploring the way swordsmanship is portrayed in both historical and fantasy contexts.

## Websites I Recommend
- [HEMA Alliance](https://www.hemaalliance.com) - A community dedicated to the study and practice of Historical European Martial Arts, where I often find resources and tutorials on sword fighting techniques.
- [Kult of Athena](https://www.kultofathena.com) - This is my go-to site for learning about swords and historical replicas. They offer a wide selection of weapons and armor from various cultures and time periods.
- [MyArmoury](https://myarmoury.com) - A fantastic website for anyone interested in swords, armor, and military history. The forums are great for learning from enthusiasts and martial artists alike.

## Additional Hobbies
Aside from swords, I love watching anime and exploring the different ways animation brings sword combat and history to life. Shows like *Rurouni Kenshin* and *Demon Slayer* are among my favorites. I also enjoy gaming, particularly RPGs where swordplay is a key part of the experience.
