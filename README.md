# aarivbhardwaj.github.io
My name is Aariv Bhardwaj, and my email address is aariv.bdj@gmail.com.

My GitHub account, under the username aarivbhardwaj, is where I will host and manage various coding projects, including web development and data-related repositories. It allows me to collaborate with others and contribute to open-source projects.

I created a repository named aarivbhardwaj.github.io, which contains a ReadMe file.


To clone the repository, I downloaded the Github Desktop app and then flicked + on the top left. This then let me clone my repository I made on github.com. I then copied it onto a folder in My Pc called Coding that houses my other repositories and projects.
